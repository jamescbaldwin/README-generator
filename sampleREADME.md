## DESCRIPTION
    The README Generator allows a user to input responses to a series of terminal-based prompts, and then have those responses collected and organized in a newly created markdown file.


## INSTALLATION
    Conveniently, the functions of the app that be executed by following 2 steps, both occurring in the terminal: first, the user will use the terminal to install node modules (“npm install”  and requisite dependencies fileshare, markdown-generator, and inquirer (“npm i fs,” “npm i markdown-generator,” & “npm i inquirer”); secondly, the user can render the series of prompts by entering “node index.js” into the terminal.

## USAGE
    This app, with the help of the installed technology, allows a user to share and create files, all synchronously while prompting user responses. Thus, a user can potentially allocate more time to developing their own projects, rather than to creating markdown files describing them.
