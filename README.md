# README GENERATOR

``` 
Using Node.js, this application will allows users to generate their own markdown files, based on responses to a series of prompts. The only requirements are a package.json, along with installed dependencies "inquirer" and "fileshare". Below are links to the GitHub repository, as well as to an instructional video outlining the functionality of the app.
